# NFL-Hall-of-Fame-Predictor
Every year 4-8 retired NFL players are inducted into the prestigious Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. This is one of the biggest honors that an NFL player can recieve, and you have to play at a very high level throughout your career to have a chance of being inducted. Making the Hall of Fame is no easy task, and out of almost 26,000 NFL players, only 300 have made the HOF (1.1%). There are several factors that the selection committe looks at to determine whether a player is worthy of making the Hall of Fame, such as career stats, playoff appearances, super bowl championships, etc. I believe its possible to predict whether a QB, RB or WR will make the Hall of Fame by just looking at career stats, and the goal of this project is to accomplish this using a linear regression estimator.
